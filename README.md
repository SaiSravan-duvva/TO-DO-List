## About

This project is a basic to-do list application developed during my internship. It allows users to add, remove, and display tasks in a to-do list. The program is built in Python, emphasizing the use of functions and data structures.

## Features

- **Display List Function**: Displays tasks in the to-do list, along with their respective indices.
- **Add Task Function**: Adds a new task to the list and provides a confirmation message.
- **Remove Task Function**: Removes a task by its index, with error handling for invalid input.
- **Main Function**: The core functionality that initializes an empty to-do list, displays a menu, and allows users to interact with the list.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing to ensure the reliability of each function.
- **Run and Debug**: Execution of the program with error handling for potential issues.

2. Run the program by executing the `main.py` file.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to add, remove, and display tasks.
